Welcome to my github repository for Fundamentals of Data Analysis. This repository contains a file titled 'Normal Distribution', which is my final assignment for this module, and a folder titled 'Practicals', which contains weekly exercises from our lectures throughout the module. I have listed below the contents for each of my practicals and a link to the lecture notes from Ian McLoughlin. <br/>
For my Normal Distribution file, I have given a list of contents and a brief description below, as well as the reference list. 

<br/>

## Practicals
<br/>

### 1. Information

**Exercise 1** <br/>
Adapt the code above to generate a 1000 character long string with weights based on the previous two characters.

**Exercise 2**<br/>
Explain why the log of zero is undefined.

<br/>

### 2. Randomness

**Exercise 1**<br/>
It is somewhat interesting that (5 * 4 * 3 * 2 * 1) perfectly divides (10 * 9 * 8 * 7 * 6) - there's no remainder. <br/>
If we only wanted exactly four heads as opposed to five, the equivalent calculation would be (10 * 9 * 8 * 7) / (4 * 3 * 2 * 1).<br/>
Does that evenly divide too? What is the formula in general?<br/>
Does it always come out as a positive whole number?<br/>

**Exercise 2**<br/>
Note that there are the same number of ways to get 4 tails as there to get 4 heads. Explain why this is.

**Exercise 3**<br/>
Plot bar charts or histograms of any three different distributions listed at the following link:<br/>

<br/>

### 3. Bias

**Exercise 1**<br/>
Give three real-world examples of different types of cognitive bias.

**Exercise 2**<br/>
Show that the difference between the standard deviation calculations is greatest for small sample sizes.

<br/>

### 4. Outliers

**Exercise 1**<br/>
Create box plots on a single set of axes for all five experiments in the morley data set.

**Exercise 2**<br/>
Create box plots for all of the numercial variables in Fisher's Iris Data Set.

**Exercise 3**<br/>
Adapt the above code and plots so that the overall plot is inversely propertional and the individual groups are directly proportional.

<br/>

### 5. Cleansing

**Exercise 1**<br/>
Write a Python function to remove all non-alphanumeric characters from a string.

**Exercise 2**<br/>
Adapt the above code to capitalise the first letter of the iris species, using regular expressions.

### Normal Distribution Assignment

**Assignment outline:**<br/>
• Create a notebook about the normal distribution.<br/>
• Define and explain the main concepts.<br/>
• Pitch the notebook at your classmates.<br/>
• Use visuals like plots to explain concepts.<br/>
